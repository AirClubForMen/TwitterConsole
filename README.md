This is an implementation of a twitter stream listener. It is a solid implementation that is used as a coding challenge. Of course it could be easily expanded upon but with the time I had it this is what I came up with. The speed seems to be running close to 40 tweets per second. I would have used a message bus and had a listener proceess the tweets if it were to be an enterprice application. I clean out the list of tweets when it reaches 1000 and reset it to the top 100 most popular. I left my twitter settings in for testing and they can be changed through the config. The Bearer token is the setting that needs to be set. I implemented a package called LinqtoTwitter to connect a listener to the Twitter stream
